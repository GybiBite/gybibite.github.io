## Welcome to FreePo!
We have designed this website for the sole purpose of non-censorship. This whole cancel-culture revolution is a joke and we strive to end it. As Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube continue to suffer from their hubris, we strive to bring solace to the users who were abandoned by their own communities that they called home and were cast out for their "actions" by speaking out for their own beliefs. Here we do not censor our users or spread our own agenda, we embrace the fact that each individual is a unique member of society that has their own personal beliefs that they strive to service. We at NoobyBite welcome all to FreePo, the freedom repository designed for non-censorship and anonymity, you can choose to make your self known or proceed as a ghost with our encryption methods that we have in place that ensure your IP won't be traced (granted you don't click fishy links). The only thing we DO NOT allow on this site is any illegal forms of media, we all love non-censorship but this is one of the fastest way to lose that right.

If you are confused as to how to use the site or what to do to continue into the depths, we recommend starting with our  [User Forums](Forums.html)  as to reach out to the community or to find your own niches.


If you are more inclined to video editing or vlogging you may check out our  [Video Repository](Videos.html)  where you can post and watch videos from other users with no risk of saying something that can lead to a "YouTube strike" or "demonetization", here you must input your age as a small verification step, this depends on the uploader in question as it is up to them to deem whether the content is explicit or not.


If you can edit images or just enjoy the occasional meme then the  [Image Board](Pictures.html)  Might be for you. here you can create boards that you could share your daily meme to or just as a photo repository for pictures that you wish to share with the world! There is a form of age verification here as well, this depends on the board that is opened though, as the modderator of the board may deem the content as not safe for children.


If you are a writer or wish to share your library of text based documents the  [Document Library](Documents.html)  would be a good place for you, here you can share your personal research papers, stories you have written, or different text based documents. You can seek out review from your peers, or critique someone else's documents.


If you are an aspiring coder, or you enjoy 3d modeling the  [File Repository](Files.html)  is what you seek. Here you can share programs you are working on, 3d models and 3d printing files, or just about any other type of file extension. This is more or less a repository of files that don't fit into the other categories.


We at NoobyBite hope you enjoy your stay at FreePo and continue to utilize our services as we have large plans in the near future. Do not be afraid to reach out to us to voice your concerns and suggestions, we are always willing to adapt to our community and users!
