		<h2>Who is NoobyBite?<h2>
		<p>NoobyBite is a small team of 2 programmers containing myself "Nooby" and my associate "GybiBite (a.k.a. DanBite)", we decided to form this group around a year ago while Nooby was still in college to create joint programs and websites. Gybi specializes in Java and <!--add more words-->. Nooby focuses on HTML, c++, and python.</p>
		<p>We strive to design and code our programs to the best of our abilities, and we realize we cant think of everything. Thats why we ask you, the users and the community, to reach out to give us suggestions and changes you wish to see in the future. </p>
